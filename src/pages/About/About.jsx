                    <p>The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering started its journey in July 1965 after its nucleation from the Department of Physics & Telecommunication from the erstwhile Bengal Engineering College. The first batch of Electronics and Telecommunication engineers graduated from the department in 1971. The Masterâ€™s program was launched in 1972 and the first batch of Post Graduates passed out in 1974. The Department so far offered a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) course in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering for 4 years (8 Semesters). From the year 2014 onward the Department has started offering 5 years (10 Semesters) Integrated Master of Technology (Dual B. Tech. + M. Tech.) program under the umbrella of the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology. Parallel Master of Engineering (M.E.) programs of 4-semester duration (2 years) are also offered for three specializations, viz. Digital Systems & Instrumentation, Microwave Communication, and Communication & Signal Processing. Department also offers the Ph.D. program in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering in various fields, like Microwaves and Antennas; Microelectronics, Devices, and VLSI; Communication and Signal processing.</p>
                    <p className='mb-4 mb-lg-5'>Considerable effort has been put forward during the last couple of years towards setting up new undergraduate and postgraduate laboratories and augmenting the facilities in the existing laboratories. The department does a commendable performance in research and development works. A good number of research projects worth a high value are being carried out with the assistance of various funding agencies leading to a high volume of quality publications in international and national journals and conferences.</p>
